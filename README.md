# Real-ESRGAN NCNN Image Upscaler

## ðŸ”§Quick Start (For going through the code.)
1. Extract this ZIP file to any folder
2. Download Real-ESRGAN NCNN models and place them in the 'models' folder
3. Download Real-ESRGAN NCNN executable and place it in the 'bin' folder
4. If you don't want to download manually then run `download_dependencies.py` file directly.
5. Run `build.py` file for generate `RealESRGAN-NCNN.exe`.
6. you have to replace `dist_final` models and bin to `download_dependencies.py` models and bin.
7. Double-click `RealESRGAN-NCNN.exe` to run the application

## ðŸ‘€Required Files Structure:
```
RealESRGAN-NCNN/
â”œâ”€â”€ RealESRGAN-NCNN.exe          # Main application
â”œâ”€â”€ bin/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ realesrgan-ncnn-vulkan.exe   # NCNN executable
â”œâ”€â”€ models/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ realesrgan-x4plus.param
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ realesrgan-x4plus.bin
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ realesrgan-x4plus-anime.param
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ realesrgan-x4plus-anime.bin
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â””â”€â”€ _internal/                   # Application dependencies (auto-generated)
```

## âš¡Usage:
1. Click 'Load Image' to select an image
2. Choose model and scale settings
3. Click 'Process Image' to upscale
4. Click 'Save Result' to save the upscaled image

## Supported Formats:
- Input: PNG, JPG, JPEG, BMP, TIF, TIFF, WEBP
- Output: JPG, PNG, WEBP

## ðŸ’»System Requirements:
- Windows 10/11 (64-bit)
- Compatible GPU (Optional; For fast proecssing)
- 4GB+ RAM
- 1GB+ free disk space

## ðŸš§Troubleshooting:
- If the app doesn't start, ensure all files are extracted properly
- If processing fails, check that the NCNN executable is in the 'bin' folder
- For GPU acceleration, ensure compatible drivers are installed

## ðŸ’ªPerformance over CPU / GPU
- CPU: Takes around 15-20 min for per image.
- GPU: Depend on GPU in my case I have NVIDIA RTX 4060 takes around 20-30 sec per img.

## Note
- Always set `Scale settings` on 4x. if set in 2x raise error because model param's can only compute for 4x.
- Always prefer less than 2k image dimentions, check h * w before processing otherwise error occur for exceeding the image pixels. You can initally decrease their pixels because after processing you get 4k level image.
